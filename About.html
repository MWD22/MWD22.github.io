                    The Reed Finance and Investment Club was founded in 2014 thanks to a donation from trustee George M. James. Now, we are the premier resource for students to gain experience in finance at Reed College. Each year, we elect club officers, participate in the CFA Research Challenge, perform analysis on our portfolio as a whole and on our holdings within our different sectors, host lectures from faculty and financial professionals as well as networking events, and execute trades to improve our portfolio. Our portfolio management process is democratic, as is our process for selecting members, officers, and changing club policy. Financial analysis at RFIC is rigorous and collaborative; facilitating a fun and challenging learning experience for our members.
